# Overview

In this software, I developed a simple animated analog clock that gets and returns the time from the OS. I developed this to learn and demonstrate my capability and competency in the javascript, css, and html language.

# Development Environment

Generative AI, documentations, and colleagues were all helpful in development. I ran the node server using the LiveNode extension in VS Studio Code.
